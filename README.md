capacity of 35.58 MW, qualifying it as a large-scale project.
____________________
The primary aim of the UCR project activity “35.58 MW Bundled Solar Power Project, initiated by
Fourth Partner Energy Private Limited, (FPEPL)” is to generate electricity through clean and
renewable solar energy sources. This project seeks to replace grid electricity consumption at the
user end with solar power, thus reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The project involves the
installation and operation of solar photovoltaic (PV) plants across ten states in India: Haryana,
Delhi, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Gujarat, Assam, Chhattisgarh, and
Jharkhand.

FPEPL, is a leading provider of integrated renewable energy solutions, primarily targeting the
commercial and industrial sectors in India and extending its services to South and Southeast Asia.
The project activity with a total installed capacity of 35.58 MW, distributed over 88 rooftop solar
energy installations, the project supports the transition to sustainable energy by offering Renewable
Energy-as-a-Service (REaaS). This allows businesses to meet nearly all their energy needs through
renewable sources, contributing significantly to the decarbonization of India's corporate sector.
The project utilizes polycrystalline solar photovoltaic technology, known for its reliability and
efficiency in converting sunlight into electricity. Solar PV modules consist of interconnected
photovoltaic cells that directly convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity. This DC
electricity is then converted to alternating current (AC) by inverters, making it compatible with the
grid. The electricity generated from these solar plants is supplied to various companies under Power
Purchase Agreements (PPA’s), effectively reducing the carbon footprint of the energy consumed.
Beyond environmental benefits, the project contributes to social and economic development by
creating employment opportunities during both the construction and operational phases. It also
encourages the adoption of advanced solar technologies, promoting innovation and technological
advancements in the renewable energy sector. In summary, the 35.58 MW Bundled Solar Power
Project by FPEPL is a significant step towards a sustainable energy future, supporting both national
and global efforts to combat climate change while fostering economic and technological growth.

The project is registered under the Universal Carbon Registry (UCR), which offers carbon
incentives for solar programs, thereby promoting the adoption of renewable energy technologies.
This project aligns with India’s ambitious renewable energy targets, aiming for 450 GW of
renewables and 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. FPEPL has strategically established 9
Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to manage and operate 88 distinct solar plants / sites across
various locations, ensuring streamlined operations and centralized management. The company now
seeks to leverage this portfolio by claiming carbon credits through UCR, underscoring its
commitment to sustainable energy and supporting both national and global efforts to combat climate
change while fostering economic and technological growth.
